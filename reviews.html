				<p>"I was extremely pleased with the services they provided to me and my animals. The owner Becky Lea and her staff are wonderful.

				<p>"Becky stayed at my house and watched my very spoiled princess Sophie. I was very nervous to leave Sophie for 6 nights with a complete stranger. Becky was an absolute blessing to us. She went above and beyond for Sophie! In fact after a day or two Sophie was looking for Becky in our guest room and pouting for her walk! I would highly recommend Paws Around Motown!" </br></br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Ashley H.</b></p>

				<p>"I was extremely impressed with the service provided by Paws Around Motown. My dogs were almost instantly comfortable and were truly happy when we returned home from our vacation. The experience was head and shoulders above the classic kennel option. Thank you Paws Around Motown for treating my pets as your own." </br></br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Tanya K.</b></p>

				<p>"Becky has been working with my dog for the last three months. My dog Gracie is a rescue dog who had major issues. She didn't trust people, exhibited fear aggression, and both my vet and dog trainer expressed concerns about her ability to be a good pet. Among the other things that I have been doing to socialize her, Becky has been coming twice a week to walk her and get her used to interacting with people. Becky has done a wonderful job. She has a knack for knowing just how to treat dogs to bring out the best in them. She has developed a great friendship with Gracie, and all she has done with Gracie has gone a long way to help make Gracie the sweet, comfortable dog that she is today.</p>

				<p>Becky has been a tremendous support and I would trust her with my much loved dog and my house. I know that I can depend on her."</br></br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Marilyn F.</b></p>

				<p>"Love Becky. She's so loving and reliable! The best walker/sitter because she loves dogs!!" </br></br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Sophia F.</b></p>

				<p>"I hired Paws Around Motown to walk my dogs when my schedule changed at work. I also asked Becky to check in on them when I went away for a few long weekends. I have two Pugs that just adore Becky! I think that deep down she treats them better than I do. After a day when she walks them I come home and they are happy to see me but also content to lay around because they got to walk. Becky is very careful and attentive to my little female pug who is overweight and has one eye. I have never had someone take such great care and show so much love to my babies. I am grateful for her services and I know my dogs love me even more for it." </br></br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Kimberlee N.</b></p>

				<p>"My Chow Chow, Synamon, loves Becky! He warmed up to her right away! Dogs can sense if people are sincere. I will trust his instincts always and have Becky walk him regularly! She is fabulous!" </br></br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Jen C.</b></p>
